In this repository you will find:

- random, possibly reusable scripts;
- possibly reusable configs;
- go code, if distributing such code in go-open or go-free doesn't
  make sense;
- all code written in other languages.

Each top level folder is developed independently from the others (except for
cases where it makes sense to create a dependency link) and as a result may be
licensed under different terms from the other code/configs in the repo.
