Moving inside the file
======================

Moving the cursor
-----------------

The cursor can be moved around using both the arrow keys and `hjkl`.
Obviously, `hjkl` cannot be used in *Insert* to this purpose.

                                ^
                           <h j k l>
                              v

Both the arrow keys are interpreted as buffer commands, which means
you can do stuff like `4l` or `4<Right>` to move the cursor right 4
characters.

Using the `hjkl` for movement instead of the arrow keys is a great
timesaver, as those keys are on the natural resting point of the right
hand on a QWERTY keyboard.

Take a moment to get comfortable with moving the cursor with the
`hjkl` keys.

(Users of alternate keyboard layouts may skip ahead and keep using the
arrows, as the `hjkl` is not much of a timesaver for them.)
