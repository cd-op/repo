Saving files
============

You can save the current file by invoking the vim command `:write`.
This command has an abbreviated form: `:w`.

Later on, when working with multiple buffers, windows or tabs, you can
use the `:wall` (`write all`) command to save all open files.

Try saving one of the files you opened in the last tutorial with the
`:w` command.

**To quit this vim window, use the command** `:q!`
