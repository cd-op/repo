Editing text
------------

This is the easy part.

When you're in *Normal*, press `i` for *Insert* mode.

In this mode the keys work just like in any other editor.

- Switch to *Normal* (`<Esc>`).
- Move the cursor to the last line.
- Press `x` to delete all characters in the last line.
- Switch to *Insert* (`i`).
- Type the sentence.
- Switch back to *Normal*.

When you're done, quit discarding the changes (`:q!`, remember?).

Hello, World!
(Copy the sentence above to this line.)
